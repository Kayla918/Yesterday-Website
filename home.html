  <font size = "6"><font color="FFFFFF"><p> Has dementia ever affected you or someone you love memory? Well we are here to tell you we have something to help. Introducing Yesterday, a fun and interactive way to bring your loved one closer to you. This website is to help your loved ones to remember yesterday. We are very excited to explore the wonders of what would happen with sound and lights. Research suggests that listening to music or seeing lights provides emotional and behavioral benefits for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia that can stimulate their brain.
